st.subheader("**Who was Nicolay?**")

st.write("[John George Nicolay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_George_Nicolay) was a German-born American author and diplomat who served as the private secretary to US President Abraham Lincoln. Nicolay collaborated with his fellow Lincoln secretary, John Hay, to compose a 10-volume biography of Lincoln's life. Their substantial research played an important role in the future scholarship of the life and times of Lincoln. This app has been named Nicolay to honor his role in documenting and preserving the words and legacy of Abraham Lincoln for future generations.")
