full_text: "Taking the nation in the aggregate, and we find its population and ratio of increase, for the several decennial periods, to be as follows:---\n\n1790 3,929,827\n\n1800 5,305,937 35.02 per cent. {ratio of\n{increase\n\n1810 7,239,814 36.45 \n\n1820 9,638,131 33.13 \n\n1830 12,866,020 33.49 \n\n1840 17,069,453 32.67 \n\n1850 23,191,876 35.87 \n\n1860 31,443,790 35.58 \n\nThis shows an average decennial increase of 34.60 per cent. in population through the seventy years from our first, to our last census yet taken. It is seen that the ratio of increase, at no one of these seven periods, is either two per cent. below, or two per cent. above, the average; thus showing how inflexible, and, consequently, how reliable, the law of increase, in our case, is. Assuming that it will continue, gives the following results:---\n\n1870 42,323,341 1910 138,918,526\n1880 56,967,216 1920 186,984,335\n1890 76,677,872 1930 251,680,914\n1900 103,208,415\n\nThese figures show that our country may be as populous as Europe now is, at some point between 1920 and 1930---say about 1925---our territory, at seventy-three and a third persons to the square mile, being of capacity to contain 217,186,000.\n\nAnd we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the chance, by the folly and evils of disunion, or by long and exhausting war springing from the only great element of national discord\nPage 534\n\namong us. While it cannot be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of secession, breeding lesser ones indefinitely, would retard population, civilization, and prosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of it would be very great and injurious.\n\nThe proposed emancipation would shorten the war, perpetuate peace, insure this increase of population, and proportionately the wealth of the country. With these, we should pay all the emancipation would cost, together with our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt, without it. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at six per cent. per annum, simple interest, from the end of our revolutionary struggle until to day, without paying anything on either principal or interest, each man of us would owe less upon that debt now, than each man owed upon it then; and this because our increase of men, through the whole period, has been greater than six per cent.; has run faster than the interest upon the debt. Thus, time alone relieves a debtor nation, so long as its population increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its debt.\n\nThis fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due; but it shows the great importance of time in this connexion---the great advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number a hundred millions, what, by a different policy, we would have to pay now, when we number but thirty one millions. In a word, it shows that a dollar will be much harder to pay for the war, than will be a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan. And then the latter will cost no blood, no precious life. It will be a saving of both.\n\nAs to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to return to bondage the class of persons therein contemplated. Some of them, doubtless, in the property sense, belong to loyal owners; and hence, provision is made in this article for compensating such.\n\nThe third article relates to the future of the freed people. It does not oblige, but merely authorizes, Congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent. This ought not to be regarded as objectionable, on the one hand, or on the other, in so much as it comes to nothing, unless by the mutual consent of the people to be deported, and the American voters, through their representatives in Congress.\n\nI cannot make it better known than it already is, that I strongly favor colonization. And yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against free colored persons remaining in the country, which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes malicious.\n\nIt is insisted that their presence would injure, and displace white\nPage 535\n\nlabor and white laborers. If there ever could be a proper time for mere catch arguments, that time surely is not now. In times like the present, men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and in eternity. Is it true, then, that colored people can displace any more white labor, by being free, than by remaining slaves? If they stay in their old places, they jostle no white laborers; if they leave their old places, they leave them open to white laborers. Logically, there is neither more nor less of it. Emancipation, even without deportation, would probably enhance the wages of white labor, and, very surely, would not reduce them. Thus, the customary amount of labor would still have to be performed; the freed people would surely not do more than their old proportion of it, and very probably, for a time, would do less, leaving an increased part to white laborers, bringing their labor into greater demand, and, consequently, enhancing the wages of it. With deportation, even to a limited extent, enhanced wages to white labor is mathematically certain. Labor is like any other commodity in the market---increase the demand for it, and you increase the price of it. Reduce the supply of black labor, by colonizing the black laborer out of the country, and, by precisely so much, you increase the demand for, and wages of, white labor."

summary: Summary: In this portion of Abraham Lincoln's Second Annual Message, he discusses the potential future population of the United States and the importance of maintaining the Union to ensure this growth. He argues that the proposed emancipation would shorten the war, promote peace, and help the country prosper. He addresses concerns about the displacement of white labor by freed slaves, stating that emancipation would likely enhance the wages of white laborers, as the demand for their labor would increase. Lincoln also reiterates his support for the colonization of freed people, while addressing some of the objections against it.
