Under the Dred Scott decision, squatter sovereignty'' squatted out of existence, tumbled down like temporary scaffolding---like the mould at the foundry served through one blast and fell back into loose sand---helped to carry an election, and then was kicked to the winds. His late joint struggle with the Republicans, against the Lecompton Constitution, involves nothing of the original Nebraska doctrine. That struggle was made on a point, the right of a people to make their own constitution, upon which he and the Republicans have never differed.\n\nThe several points of the Dred Scott decision, in connection with Senator Douglas' care not'' policy, constitute the piece of machinery, in its present state of advancement. This was the third point gained.\n\nThe working points of that machinery are:\n\nFirst, that no negro slave, imported as such from Africa, and no descendant of such slave can ever be a citizen of any State, in the sense of that term as used in the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThis point is made in order to deprive the negro, in every possible event, of the benefit of this provision of the United States Constitution, which declares that---\n\nThe citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.''\n\nSecondly, that subject to the Constitution of the United States,'' neither Congress nor a Territorial Legislature can exclude slavery from any United States territory.\n\nThis point is made in order that individual men may fill up the territories with slaves, without danger of losing them as property, and thus to enhance the chances of permanency to the institution through all the future.\n\nThirdly, that whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free State, makes him free, as against the holder, the United States courts will not decide, but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave State the negro may be forced into by the master.\n\nThis point is made, not to be pressed immediately; but, if acquiesced in for a while, and apparently indorsed by the people at an election, then to sustain the logical conclusion that what Dred Scott's master might lawfully do with Dred Scott, in the free State of Illinois, every other master may lawfully do with any other one, or one thousand slaves, in Illinois, or in any other free State.\n\nAuxiliary to all this, and working hand in hand with it, the Nebraska doctrine, or what is left of it, is to educate and mould public opinion, at least Northern public opinion, to not care whether slavery is voted down or voted up.\n\nThis shows exactly where we now are; and partially also, whither we are tending.\n\nIt will throw additional light on the latter, to go back, and run the mind over the string of historical facts already stated. Several things will now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were transpiring. The people were to be left perfectly free'' subject only to the Constitution.'' What the Constitution had to do with it, outsiders could not then see. Plainly enough now, it was an exactly fitted niche, for the Dred Scott decision to afterwards come in, and declare the perfect freedom of the people, to be just no freedom at all.\n\nWhy was the amendment, expressly declaring the right of the people to exclude slavery, voted down? Plainly enough now, the adoption of it, would have spoiled the niche for the Dred Scott decision.\n Why was the court decision held up? Why, even a Senator's individual opinion withheld, till after the Presidential election? Plainly enough now, the speaking out then would have damaged the ``perfectly free'' argument upon which the election was to be carried.\n Why the outgoing President's felicitation on the indorsement? Why the delay of a reargument? Why the incoming President's advance exhortation in favor of the decision?\n These things look like the cautious patting and petting a spirited horse, preparatory to mounting him, when it is dreaded that he may give the rider a fall.\n And why the hasty after indorsements of the decision by the President and others?\n We can not absolutely know that all these exact adaptations are the result of preconcert. But when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places and by different workmen---Stephen, Franklin, Roger and James, for instance---and when we see these timbers joined together, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting, and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places, and not a piece too many or too few---not omitting even scaffolding---or, if a single piece be lacking, we can see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared to yet bring such piece in---in such a case, we find it impossible to not believe that Stephen and Franklin and Roger and James all understood one another from the beginning, and all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn up before the first lick was struck."

summary: Summary: In this part of the "House Divided" speech, Abraham Lincoln dissects the Dred Scott decision and its consequences, arguing that it was designed to further the spread of slavery. He highlights three working points of the decision that serve to restrict the rights of slaves and empower slaveholders. Additionally, Lincoln criticizes Senator Douglas' position on the Nebraska doctrine as a tool to influence public opinion to be indifferent about slavery. He suggests that these events and decisions appear coordinated to promote a pro-slavery agenda, comparing them to the construction of a house where each piece is deliberately crafted and fits perfectly into place.
