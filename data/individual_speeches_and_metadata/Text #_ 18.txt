full_text: "Mr. PRESIDENT and Gentlemen of the Convention.\n\nIf we could first know where we are, and whither we are tending, we could then better judge what to do, and how to do it.\n\nWe are now far into the fifth year, since a policy was initiated, with the avowed object, and confident promise, of putting an end to slavery agitation.\n\nUnder the operation of that policy, that agitation has not only, not ceased, but has constantly augmented.\n\nIn my opinion, it will not cease, until a crisis shall have been reached, and passed.\n\nA ? house divided against itself cannot stand.''\n\nI believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free.\n\nI do not expect the Union to be dissolved---I do not expect the house to fall---but I do expect it will cease to be divided.\n\nIt will become all one thing, or all the other.\n\nEither the opponents of slavery, will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it forward, till it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new---North as well as South.\n\nHave we no tendency to the latter condition?\n\nLet any one who doubts, carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination---piece of machinery so to speak---compounded of the Nebraska doctrine, and the Dred Scott decision. Let him consider not only what work the machinery is adapted to do, and how well adapted; but also, let him study the history of its construction, and trace, if he can, or rather fail, if he can, to trace the evidences of design, and concert of action, among its chief bosses, from the beginning.\n\nBut, so far, Congress only, had acted; and an indorsement by the people, real or apparent, was indispensable, to save the point already gained, and give chance for more.\n\nThe new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the States by State Constitutions, and from most of the national territory by Congressional prohibition.\n\nFour days later, commenced the struggle, which ended in repealing that Congressional prohibition.\n\nThis opened all the national territory to slavery; and was the first point gained.\n\nThis necessity had not been overlooked; but had been provided for, as well as might be, in the notable argument of squatter sovereignty,'' otherwise called sacred right of self government,'' which latter phrase, though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government, was so perverted in this attempted use of it as to amount to just this: That if any one man, choose to enslave another, no third man shall be allowed to object.\n\nThat argument was incorporated into the Nebraska bill itself, in the language which follows: It being the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any Territory or state, nor to exclude it therefrom; but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.''\n\nThen opened the roar of loose declamation in favor of Squatter Sovereignty,'' and Sacred right of self government.''\n\nBut,'' said opposition members, let us be more specific---let us amend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the territory may exclude slavery.'' ``Not we,'' said the friends of the measure; and down they voted the amendment.\n\nWhile the Nebraska bill was passing through congress, a law case, involving the question of a negroe's freedom, by reason of his owner having voluntarily taken him first into a free state and then a territory covered by the congressional prohibition, and held him as a slave, for a long time in each, was passing through the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Missouri; and both Nebraska bill and law suit were brought to a decision in the same month of May, 1854. The negroe's name was Dred Scott,'' which name now designates the decision finally made in the case.\n\nBefore the then next Presidential election, the law case came to, and was argued in the Supreme Court of the United States; but the decision of it was deferred until after the election. Still, before the election, Senator Trumbull, on the floor of the Senate, requests the leading advocate of the Nebraska bill to state his opinion whether the people of a territory can constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits; and the latter answers, That is a question for the Supreme Court.''\n\nThe election came. Mr. Buchanan was elected, and the indorsement, such as it was, secured. That was the second point gained. The indorsement, however, fell short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred thousand votes, and so, perhaps, was not overwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory.\n\nThe outgoing President, in his last annual message, as impressively as possible echoed back upon the people the weight and authority of the indorsement.\n\nThe Supreme Court met again; did not announce their decision, but ordered a re-argument.\n\nThe Presidential inauguration came, and still no decision of the court; but the incoming President, in his inaugural address, fervently exhorted the people to abide by the forthcoming decision, whatever it might be.\n\nThen, in a few days, came the decision.\n\nThe reputed author of the Nebraska bill finds an early occasion to make a speech at this capitol indorsing the Dred Scott Decision, and vehemently denouncing all opposition to it.\n\nThe new President, too, seizes the early occasion of the Silliman letter to indorse and strongly construe that decision, and to express his astonishment that any different view had ever been entertained.\n\nAt length a squabble springs up between the President and the author of the Nebraska bill, on the mere question of fact, whether the Lecompton constitution was or was not, in any just sense, made by the people of Kansas; and in that squabble the latter declares that all he wants is a fair vote for the people, and that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up. I do not understand his declaration that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up, to be intended by him other than as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the public mind---the principle for which he declares he has suffered much, and is ready to suffer to the end."

summary: Summary: In the "House Divided" speech, Abraham Lincoln argues that the United States cannot continue as a nation divided on the issue of slavery, stating that it will either become all free or all slave. He criticizes the policy of allowing new territories to decide on the legality of slavery, a policy that has only increased the national debate. Lincoln highlights the Dred Scott decision and the Nebraska bill as evidence of the growing divide and a potential concerted effort to spread slavery. He also mentions political disagreements between the President and the author of the Nebraska bill, emphasizing that the ultimate concern should be the will of the people.
