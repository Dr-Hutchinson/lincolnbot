(Second Annual Message, December 1, 1862).

(Second Annual Message, December 1, 1862). This reference to deportation reflects Lincoln's consideration of colonization - a concept popular at the time, which involved resettling freed slaves in Africa or Central America. It was part of his broader plan to address the challenges of integrating a significant number of freed slaves into the American society and economy. His Third Annual Message in 1863 emphasizes his endorsement of state-led emancipation efforts as a component of his national reconstruction strategy: 'The movements, by State action, for emancipation in several of the States... my general views and feelings remain unchanged...'

(First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861). However, in his 'House Divided' speech, Lincoln offered a more nuanced view of popular sovereignty.

(A House Divided Speech, June 16, 1858). This critique reflects Lincoln's belief that while popular sovereignty is fundamental, it must be guided by moral imperatives and a commitment to national unity. Furthermore, in his July 4th Message to Congress, Lincoln expressed his confidence in the people's ability to sustain their government, highlighting the reciprocal relationship between the government and the governed: 'In a word, the people will save their government, if the government itself, will do its part, only indifferently well.'
