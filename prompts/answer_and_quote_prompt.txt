Text Number: 59

Source: Second Annual Message. December 1, 1863

The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have, during the past year, manifested a spirit of insubordination, and, at several points, have engaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in their vicinity. The tribes occupying the Indian country south of Kansas, renounced their allegiance to the United States, and entered into treaties with the insurgents. Those who remained loyal to the United States were driven from the country. The chief of the Cherokees has visited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relations of the tribe with the United States. He alleges that they were constrained, by superior force, to enter into treaties with the insurgents, and that the United States neglected to furnish the protection which their treaty stipulations required.

Text Number#: 72: 

Source: Fourth Annual Message. December 6, 1864.

Owing to the peculiar situation of Japan, and the anomalous form of its government, the action of that empire in performing treaty stipulations is inconstant and capricious. Nevertheless, good progress has been effected by the western powers, moving with enlightened concert. Our own pecuniary claims have been allowed, or put in course of settlement, and the inland sea has been reopened to commerce. There is reason also to believe that these proceedings have increased rather than diminished the friendship of Japan towards the United States.

Compose Initial Answer: Yes, Lincoln discusses Japan in his Fourth Annual Message of December 6, 1854, stating that the peculiar situation and anomalous form of government of Japan have made their actions in performing treaty stipulations inconsistent and capricious. However, he notes that progress has been made by the western powers in working together and that our own pecuniary claims have been allowed or put in settlement. Additionally, the inland sea has been reopened to commerce, and these proceedings have likely increased Japan's friendship towards the United States.

Text Number 72).

Combined Answer with Supporting Quote: Yes, Lincoln discusses Japan in his Fourth Annual Message of December 6, 1864. Lincoln acknowledged that "the action of [Japan] in performing treaty stipulations is inconstant and capricious" due to their "peculiar situation" and "anomalous form of government." However, he also noted that "good progress has been effected by the western powers, moving with enlightened concert," as evidenced by the settlement of the United States' pecuniary claims and the reopening of the inland sea to commerce. Lincoln further suggested that these efforts had "increased rather than diminished the friendship of Japan towards the United States." Thus, this message reflects Lincoln's recognition of the importance of international cooperation and diplomacy in navigating complex political and cultural landscapes such as that of Japan during the Late Tokugawa period.
